# jellyfin_playlist_exporter
Little script to export jelyfin playlists as m3u8

At the moment this is just a python file you need to manually run. The jellyfin playlist directory is hardcoded at the begining of the file. It worked for me on Debian stable, any help appreciated to port to other configs / os / whatever.
