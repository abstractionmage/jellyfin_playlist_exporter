# jellyfin_playlist_exporter
Little script to export jelyfin playlists as m3u8

At the moment this is just a python file you need to manually run. The jellyfin playlist directory is hardcoded at the begining of the file. It worked for me on Debian stable, any help appreciated to port to other configs / os / whatever.

# Ideas

Will not happen. or maybe.

[] Choose directory or whatever adaptation required to handle docker / most common setup
[] Fix where playlist are exported
[] Allow to amend songs path en masse? cause when someone exports it may be due to larger config change
[] Other OS ?
